Write a program that takes these values to find all of the different patterns in "input" of length "patternLength"
and output all of the patterns that occur more than once and the number of times they occur.

For example, when searching the string "zf3kabxcde224lkzf3mabxc51+crsdtzf3nab=", 
with a specified pattern length of 3, the method should return the pattern "abx” 
with an occurrence value of two, and “zf3” with an occurrence value of three.
